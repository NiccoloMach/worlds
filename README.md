### How to run

In order to run the project you need a local server. You can use MAMP:

[https://www.mamp.info/](https://www.mamp.info/)

Or run Python's built-in http server.
In terminal, browse to the repo and run:

```sh
# Python 2.x
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

```sh
# Python 3.x
python -m http.server
```

And once you commit your changes, and want to see them in Google Cardboard:
